# SmoothScrollFirefox

This repo contains modified user.js files that change the default scrolling behaviour in Firefox.<br>
I made various versions, although these were made on a 35'' UltraWide Monitor, speed settings *may* have to be adjusted<br>

Just copy the code of the profile you want and paste it in your user.js<br>
The user.js file is located in C:\Users\<yourusername>\AppData\Roaming\Firefox\Profiles\<yourprofilename>\
If you have more than one profile and don't know which one to choose, go with the most recent one (Date modified.)<br>
If you don't have a user.js inside your folder, just create one.

# Further Tweaks

If you're annoyed like me and Alt is always opening the Firefox menu, go to About:config and change "ui.key.menuAccessKey" to False
