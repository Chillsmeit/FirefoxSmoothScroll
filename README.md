# FirefoxSmoothScroll

**Tries to deliver a smoother scrolling experience in Firefox** <br>
- *Works in any OS, and Firefox forks (Librewolf, Mullvad browser, etc)* <br>

#### How to "Install"?
- Just copy this repository `user.js` to your Firefox profile folder<br>
#### How do you find your Firefox profile folder?
- In the Firefox address bar type `about:support` click `Open Directory` in `Profile Directory`
- Drag and drop the `user.js` into the folder


#### If you use Firefox with Arkenfox, Librewolf or Mullvad:
- The flag `privacy.resistFingerprinting` when set `True` locks the framerate to 60hz
- This should only be noticeable in monitors with a higher refresh rate
- My `user.js` by default sets it to `false`.


#### Optional:
- I included in this repository two cosmetic tweaks.
- Shorter flexible spaces that look like this:<br>

- And smaller and less intrusive PiP icon that shows up in the upper left corner in videos:

#### How to "Install" Optional?
- Either download the chrome.zip from the releases tab and extract it or download the repo source code
- Go into your Firefox Profile directory and put the chrome folder there
