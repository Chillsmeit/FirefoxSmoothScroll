# SnapFluidFox

This repo contains a modified user.js files that change the default scrolling behaviour in Firefox.<br>
It's supposed to be snappy and fluid (made it for my 35''UW, speed settings may have to be adjusted)<br>
Just copy the code of the profile you chose and paste it in your user.js

I personally use the SnapFluidFoxFaster.js

# Further Tweaks

If you're annoyed like me and Alt is always opening the Firefox menu, go to About:config
Change "ui.key.menuAccessKey" to False
